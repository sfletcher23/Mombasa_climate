function  [yield_ddp,release_ddp, K_ddp]  = opt_ddp(net_inflow, eff_storage, dmd_dom, dmd_ag, costParam)
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Uses DDP to find the optimal release policy if runParam.optReservoir == true
%   that minimizes the shortage costs, accounting for the cost of agriculture
%   and domestic shortages seperately as defined in costParam

% INPUTS:
%   net_inflow is the net inflow into the reservoir (inflow - environmental
%   flow - evaporation) in MCM/y starting in January
%   eff_storage (K) is a scalar representing total reservoir storage - dead storage
%   dmd_dom is a monthly time series of domestic demands in MCM/y
%   dmd_ag is a monthly time series of agricultural demand in MCM/y
%   costParam is a structure defined in sdp_climate that defines
%   agricultural and domestic shortage costs

% OUTPUTS:
%   yield_ddp is a monthly time series of met demand from the optimized reservoir
%   release_ddp is a monthly time series of total release from the optimized
%   reservoir (including excess overflow)
%   K_ddp is a monthly time series of effective reservoir storages (no dead storage) for the optimized
%   reservoir
