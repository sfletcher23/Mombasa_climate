% DESCRIPTION:
%   Uses DDP to find the optimal release policy if runParam.optReservoir == true
%   that minimizes the shortage costs, accounting for the cost of agriculture
%   and domestic shortages seperately as defined in costParam. This script
%   structure has been adapted for running on the cluster and does not
%   consider desalination. Run for each temperature and precipitation state
%   combination and save results in individual files (note - currently for
%   each storage

% INPUTS:
%   inflow is a monthly time series of runoff in MCM/y starting in January
%   T is a monthly time series of temperature for 100 samples corresponding to index_s_t (from cell of T_ts{_,_,_})
%   P is a monthly time series of precipitation for 100 samples corresponding to index_s_p (from cell of P_ts{_,_,_})
%   storage is the total storage capacity of the reservoir in MCM (i.e. [80, 120])
%   costParam is a structure defined in sdp_climate that defines agricultural and domestic shortage costs

% OUTPUTS:
%   shortageCost is the mean expected shortage cost for the T and P states
%   yield is a monthly time series of met demand from releases from the optimized reservoir
%   K is a monthly time series of effective reservoir storages (no dead storage) for the optimized
%   reservoir
